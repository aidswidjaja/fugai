# Fugai
Cross-platform and open-source overlay for rapid communication and information with minimal performance impact for macOS and Linux and maybe Windows.

## Design Principles

- Lightweight - there shouldn't be a noticeable impact when gaming or running other resource-heavy programs.
- Easy to use - a user shouldn't have to be experienced in Python, window managers, calculus, etc. to get started with Pyramid Overlay.
- Do what works, not what's right - no solution is overkill. That being said...
- Modular - code and end user UI should be flexible and versatile. Don't dig yourself into a hole with your own code.

## Dependencies

If compiling from source (as opposed to binaries) the most current list of dependencies can be found below:
- Python 3.8.3rc1
- PyQt5

That's a lot of ðŸ¥§!
